# BIL-WALLET
BIL-WALLET is a Gnosis Safe multi-signature smart contract wallet that requires at least four private key signatures to confirm and execute a transaction. People donate money to the BIL-WALLET address, which is managed by a council of seven people. Entities must submit a proposal grant request form to the BIL-WALLET space in snapshot.org, the council of the wallet validates the proposal grant request, and if approved, the funds in the BIL-WALLET are provided to the entity to cover the costs of writing a proposal for the BIL grant application.
